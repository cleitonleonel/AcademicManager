        Generates a PDF based on provided metadata and template.

        This static method creates and formats a PDF document using the contents
        provided in the metadata and template dictionaries. Additional resources
        such as logos or masks are also utilized if they exist in the expected
        directory layout for the project. After processing and formatting the
        PDF content (e.g. adding cover, sections, and back cover), the resulting
        file is saved to the disk.
